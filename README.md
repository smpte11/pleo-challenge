## Antaeus

Antaeus (/ænˈtiːəs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.

## Coding challenge process
I'll try to follow a mainly commit by commit process to explain my choice

First thing I did was to install the Arrow library (probably the only lib I know in Kotlin)

I did that for a couple of reasons:

1. I needed to understand how Gradle works on the surface since I have no prior experience with it. Installing (or figuring where to install it).
2. I have also know experience in Kotlin but I have experience with Scala and Cats. This lib covers the same topics as Cats and so it feels a bit more familiar
3. I wanted to show something that I'm quite interested in these days
